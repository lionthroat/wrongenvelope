- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @wrongenvelope, currently a third-year CS student at Oregon State University.
- I formerly worked in the Navy as a linguist and as a graphic designer.
- AI is my focus, my minor is in math.
- My interests include planetary astronomy, astrobiology, and environmental sensing for semi-aquatic environments.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: theory of computation, algorithms, and intro to networks in accelerated summer courses!
- Leave me alone for five minutes and I will: start building a GUI, read Jon Postel's RFCs, acquire new crustaceans, and fail at doing pull-ups again.
